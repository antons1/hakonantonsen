                            This site is a place where I write about whatever I think about, so the content will vary. I try to show 
                            some photos and other creative work I do, as well as software and technology, and, as I said, whatever I 
                            think about.

                            You can also try to reach me on one of the links in the footer, but I am not that good at checking them that often...
